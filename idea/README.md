In the existing scenario of public restrooms in our country, the lack of access to a clean and safe toilet for women is further a serious matter of concern. The situation becomes worse when a woman travels outside and wants to access a clean toilet or has any other sanitation needs.  

To address this issue, the application RestMap is particularly designed for women to help them locate a nearby restroom and address other sanitation related issues, especially when they are travelling outside. 

For details, please check PPT and demo video.
